Alchemy Solver
==============

This is a game solver for the Alchemy game found in the Chrome Web Store or at
http://alchemy.l8r.pl/. Using this program is called cheating, though it was
fun to make the solver.

The program requires Python, PyGraphviz, and Graphviz to run.

Run it without any arguments to create a PNG file showing the complete solution
of the game::

    python alchemy.py
